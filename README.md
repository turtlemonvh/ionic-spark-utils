# Ionic Spark Util

A set of utilities for working with Ionic encryption in Spark.

Main components include

* authentication (creating the initial device / Ionic agent)
* metadata (harvesting metadata for more interesting contexts)
* transformers (for working with dataframes)
* caching and key re-use
* testing patterns for more complex applications

## Status

```
